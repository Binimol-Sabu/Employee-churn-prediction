#  Employee Attrition Analysis

This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques and communicate insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. It combines statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and business intelligence to support HR decision-making.

## üîß Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib,seaborn)
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBClassifier
- **Visualization:** Power BI


## üß™ Machine Learning Workflow
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis
- Trained and compared multiple models
- Used cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- **Random Forest** was selected as the final model based on its performance

## üìä Power BI Dashboard Insights

Key business findings from the data:
- **Attrition is significantly higher among employees who work overtime.**
- **R&D department** has both the **highest attrition** and **more overtime** than other departments.
- **Male employees** tend to work more overtime.
- **Female employees** show **slightly higher churn**.
- **Data Analyst roles** exhibit **comparatively higher attrition**.
- Employees with **lower monthly income and low environment satisfaction** are more likely to leave.

## ‚úÖ Project Outcome
- Developed a machine learning model that predicts employee attrition with good accuracy.
- Delivered a **Power BI dashboard** to highlight key patterns and enable HR teams to take proactive retention measures.
